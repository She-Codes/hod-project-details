  <h1>IHOD Redesign</h1>
  <h2>Currently In Progress.</h2>
  <p>IHOD was originally built using Ruby on Rails for the backend and jQuery Mobile for the frontend.  
  Having been several years since the app was originally built I felt it was time to update the 
  frontend of the app.  The new face of IHOD is currently in progress using Bootstrap, jQuery and as much vanilla JavaScript as possible. We are a small team and 
  did not want to use a JavaScript framework such as React since most of the team is unfamiliar and the timeframe did not allow for everyone to get up to speed.  We also felt that 
  the needs of the app could be met just fine minus a framework as long as code was modularized and written cleanly.  
  I made the decision to keep the color scheme similar as users in the organization tend to be generally averse to too much change at once.</p>

<div class="examples">
  <h3 class="all-bills">All Bills</h3>
  <p class="description all-bills">The All Bills view is a list of bills that can be toggled between category types, and where 
  additional information such as comments and staff summaries can be toggled on and off.  There is a filter for the list 
  which was rewritten using vanilla JavaScript since the jQuery Mobile widget would no longer be used.  Comment and Staff Summary 
  elements are only filtered when they are turned on.  Removing some buttons and labels and left-aligning 
  everything I felt gave the header area a less cluttered look.  The list itself was not changed much.  
  Below the original view is shown first, followed by the updated version.</p>

  <h3 class="all-bills-comments">All Bills View With Comments</h3>
  <p class="description all-bills-comments">As mentioned above, the list was not changed much other than giving a uniform 
  background to the entire list.  I also felt that removing the circular background from 
  the comments created a less cluttered look.</p>

  <h3 class="viewing-comments">Viewing Comments</h3>
  <p class="description viewing-comments">Bill comments are one example of several areas within the app 
  where the user is navigated to a new page to display a small amount of information.  In the new version this 
  is resolved with the use of modals.</p>

  <div class="image viewing-comments"><img src='../images/iHOD-comment-show-redesign.png' alt="ihod comment show view redesign"></div>

  <h3 class="editing-deleting-comments">Editing and Deleting Comments</h3>
  <p class="description editing-deleting-comments">Taking it a step further, keeping the user on the same page 
  not just for viewing a comment, but for editing and deleting it as well creates a more seamless experience for the user.</p>
