  <h1>House Minutes Application</h1>
  <h2>Virginia House of Delegates application 
  used to record the journal day of a legislative session.</h2>
  <p>This app was built using a Rails backend and a combination of Bootstrap, jQuery, vanilla JavaScript, and SASS for the frontend.
  The majority of the JavaScript was written by myself using vanilla when possible, with some
  jQuery sprinkled in to work with Bootstrap plugins and for AJAX calls to the backend APIs.  The app is used in real-time during a legislative session so speed, accuracy and ease-of-use is paramount.</p>
</header>

<div class="examples">
  <div class="explanation minutes-intro">
    <h3>Intro Screen</h3>
    <p>This was just a fun intro I added to the app to greet the user once they login.
    This was built entirely in CSS and uses CSS animations.  For a live example,
    you can take a look at this <a href="https://codepen.io/she_codes/full/XVrPLp/" target="_blank">Codepen</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="image"><img src='../images/minutes-app-intro.gif' alt="minutes intro"></div>

  <div class="explanation minutes-menu">
    <h3>App Menus</h3>
    <p>There are several areas of the app that require their own menus.
    The user is easily able to transition between the main application menu and the
    current menu unique to that area of the app.  There is also the ability to hide all menus and expand the main 
    viewing area.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image"><img src='../images/minutes-app-main-menu.gif' alt="minutes menus"></div>

  <div class="explanation minutes-passed">
    <h3>Menu Actions</h3>
    <p>This is an example of communication with the backend API.  A user is able to select multiple
    rows and apply a menu action, the results of which are immediately reflected
    in the corresponding rows via AJAX.  There are several other features  
    in this section of the app including disabling menus depending on which selections are made, 
    deleting previously added actions, and adding custom actions not available by menu.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image"><img src='../images/minutes-app-passed-block2.gif' alt="minutes passed block"></div>

  <div class="explanation minutes-custom-action">
    <h3>Custom Actions</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, the user can dynamically add a custom action without using the menu.  A small CSS animation provides feedback to the user that
    the action was saved on the server side.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image"><img src='../images/minutes-app-custom-action.gif' alt="minutes custom action"></div>

  <div class="explanation minutes-changes">
    <h3>Detecting Changes</h3>
    <p>Once the document is changed, the indicator on the save button changes to alert the user that changes 
    need to be saved.  The app detects changes on keyup, whether items have been rearranged via 
    'drag and drop', and whether items have been added via the menus.  If the user tries to navigate
    away without saving changes, they receive a warning.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image"><img src='../images/minutes-app-detect-changes.gif', alt="minutes detect changes"></div>

  <div class="explanation minutes-delete">
    <h3>Deleting Items</h3>
    <p>Items can easily be deleted using a control that appears when the item item is either hovered or active.
    Because this is a destructive action the UI prompts the user to click twice by initially changing shape.
    To cancel a delete, the user can simply click elsewhere on the page.</p>
